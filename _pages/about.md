Hey! I'm a bassist, composer, and computer scientist currently pursuing a degree in computer science and music at Yale University. I'm especially interested in making software that leverage modern computational methods to augment rather than supress artistic creativity. As a musician, I enjoy writing cross-genre music that combines seemingly disparate harmonic idioms from the past several hundred years and ranges from orchestral to electro-acoustic to EDM. You can find some of my [music](songs) and [research](projects) here on this page.
