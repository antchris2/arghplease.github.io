In the deepest corner of a dusty spare room in my childhood home, there stands a little cabinet where, for whatever reason, all sorts of heirlooms and knickknacks from my past lay rest. There’s the usual things once would expect to find in such a place: old rec leauge sports medals, grade school report cards, and raggedy yet charming bits of yarn and stick from an arts and crafts time long ago. But also I realized one day that there are other things in that place too, artifacts from a time much closer to the present that possess a strange emotional power. There’s gifts, both received from others, but also some intended for people I never saw again; letters and musings to and from individuals whose influence over my life has long since faded away, and relics of a me who only partially represents the self I currently am. 

I sat and pondered for a while one day when I noticed this, ruminating over how odd it is that this lonely cabinet contains so many memories and so many emotions bottled up within it. Memory is strange, I remember pondering in one of the many overly pretentious melancholic bouts of thinking of which I’m prone. Despite meaning so much to me in those moments, all of these thoughts and feelings once in my head have been reduced to small physical artifacts, perhaps only representing a fraction of the power they once had over me and surely having long since been corrupted from what they once actually were. 

I decided then to write a piece for my instrument, the double bass and electronics to explore this notion of memory and corruptions thereupon. The piece begins with live unprocessed bass, and that sample is played back to increasing degrees of degradation as the piece continues, mirroring the decay and fading of memories in our own head with the passing of time. 

The resulting musical artifact uses playback in conjunction with live performance and processing, particularly granular synthesis, to ask the question, what does it really mean when we say we remember?
