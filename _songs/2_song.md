The most fundamental question that underlies all my pursuits, whether they be technical or artistic, is exploring how technology will shape the way art is made. Just a hundred years ago, for example, many of the now essential tools of modern music-making, like the DAW, the recording studio, and the sampler, simply did not exist, and their introduction profoundly shaped the creative processes of many artists since. 


<i>with tender majesty</i> is one such experiment in updating old forms with modern technologies. I initially pitched the piece as a sort of “art song of the future” - a fusion of old with new via the use of electronics, which here take the form of a harmonizer and electric bass. This piece started as a purely acoustic duet so I could perform with a dear friend, but during the course of its composition I found myself adding more and more electronic elements until it arrived in its current form.


The text is a contrapuntal poem, assembled from a number of works by Emily Dickinson. I was uninterested with the literal meaning of the texts at the time of their composition, and instead wanted to, much like the musical content itself, develop a new language of expression while also maintaining some tether to the past.
